# Heart Disease Classification using Machine Learning

A supervised learning project that builds and compares multiple machine learning models to predict heart disease based on clinical data. The dataset is sourced from the **UCI Heart Disease Repository** and includes medical attributes like chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and ECG results.

## Problem Definition

Can we use machine learning to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their clinical parameters?

## Dataset

- **Original Source**: [UCI Heart Disease Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease)
- **Kaggle Version**: [Heart Disease Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset)
- **Rows**: ~303 samples  
- **Target**: `target` (1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights:
- Balanced class distribution.
- Correlation matrix and bar plots used to explore feature relationships.
- Gender, chest pain type, and max heart rate showed significant influence.

## Models Used

### Classical Models
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Neural Network

## Methodology

1. **EDA**: Correlations, visualizations, and missing value checks.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Normalization and encoding handled.
3. **Model Training**: Split into 80% training and 20% test.
4. **Model Comparison**: Evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.
5. **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for robust metrics.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Logistic Regression: `GridSearchCV` + `RandomizedSearchCV`
   - Random Forest: `RandomizedSearchCV`
7. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve
